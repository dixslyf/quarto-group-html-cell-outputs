## About

This document demonstrates the Quarto `wrap-cell-outputs` filter extension.

When Quarto renders to HTML, the cell's code block and `stdout` & `stderr` outputs
are translated to sibling `div`s.
Unfortunately, input formats like Jupyter notebooks can have heavily interleaved `stdout` and `stderr` outputs,
resulting in a long list of cell output `div`s.
Because these `div`s are siblings of the code cell's `div`,
they cannot be scrolled or collapsed as a single unit.

This filter resolves that problem by wrapping cell outputs into a single `div` parent element.
By default, the `div` is given the `cell-output-container` class, which comes with a preset style.

## Usage

When this filter is applied with the default settings,
all cell outputs are automatically wrapped in a `div` with the `cell-output-container` class.

```{python}
import sys

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f"Output stdout {i}")

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f"Output stderr {i}", file=sys.stderr)
```
